Social Graphing for the Discogs Database

## What is this?

Disco/graph is an interactive visualization of the relationships between
musicians, bands and labels. :notes:

All of Disco/graph's data is derived from the [Discogs](http://www.discogs.com)
discography database: nearly 4 million artists, 1 million labels, and 7 million
releases creating a network of nearly 70 million different relationships.

## How do I use this?

Visit the live site at TBD.

Type an artist name into the search box and go!

What do all of these symbols mean?

* Small circles represent artists.
* Large circles represent bands.
* Solid lines show artist/band and sublabel/parent-label membership.
* Dashed lines show pseudonyms between artists (*AKA*).
* Dotted lines show all kinds of other relationships, like "artist X played
  guitar for artist Y" or "artist P did cover art for label Q".

The graph shows at most 100 entities at a time, so double-click on any circle
containing a plus-sign to reveal more connections.

As mentioned, the data used is straight from Discogs, so if there are any
omissions or errors, please add or correct the artist on their website.
