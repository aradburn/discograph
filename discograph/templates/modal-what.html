                <p><strong>DiscoGraph2</strong> is an interactive
                visualization of the relationships between musicians, bands
                and labels.</p>
                    
                <p>All of <strong>DiscoGraph2</strong>'s data is derived
                from the <a href="http://discogs.com">Discogs.com</a>
                discography database: nearly 5 million artists, 1 million
                labels, and 10 million releases creating a network of nearly
                100 million different relationships.</p>

                <p>What do all of these symbols mean?</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Small circles represent artists.</li>
                    <li>Large circles represent bands.</li>
                    <li>Squares represent labels and other companies.</li>
                    <li>Solid lines show band membership.</li>
                    <li>Dashed lines show pseudonyms.</li>
                    <li>Dotted lines show other kinds of relations.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The graph only shows at most 100 entities at a time, so
                double-click on any circle containing a plus-sign to reveal
                more connections.</p>
